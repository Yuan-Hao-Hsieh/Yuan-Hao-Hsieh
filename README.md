# Hi there, Iâ€™m Yuan-Hao Hsieh (Howard) ðŸ‘‹

**I'm interested in**  
- Advanced data analytics, machine learning, and real-world data (RWD) research  
- Statistical modeling, including regression, PCA, and longitudinal data analysis  
- Bridging academic research and industry applications

**I'm currently learning**  
- Linear mixed models and optimization techniques in my M.S. in Industrial Engineering at NTU  
- Novel variable selection methods (e.g., Lasso, Elastic Net) for high-dimensional data  
- Database management and cloud-based data pipelines for real-world evidence

**I'm looking to collaborate on**  
- Open-source data science projects  
- RWD-based studies that complement clinical trials (particularly for rare diseases)  
- Innovative solutions in machine learning and deep learning
